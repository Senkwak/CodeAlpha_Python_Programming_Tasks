## ✅ Task 1 — Hangman Game
A text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.
- 5 predefined words, chosen randomly
- Maximum of 6 incorrect guesses
- ASCII-art hangman drawing that updates with each mistake
- Console input/output only

**Concepts used:** `random`, `while` loop, `if-else`, strings, lists

---

## ✅ Task 2 — Stock Portfolio Tracker
A simple stock tracker that calculates total investment value based on hardcoded stock prices.
- User inputs stock symbols and quantities
- Hardcoded dictionary of stock prices (e.g. `{"AAPL": 182.50, "TSLA": 248.00}`)
- Displays a formatted investment report with total value
- Optional export to `.csv` or `.txt`

**Concepts used:** dictionary, input/output, arithmetic, file handling (optional)

---

## ✅ Task 3 — Task Automation with Python Scripts
A menu-driven automation tool offering 3 real-life automation options:
- **A.** Move all `.jpg` files from a folder to a new folder
- **B.** Extract all email addresses from a `.txt` file using regex and save them
- **C.** Scrape the `<title>` of a fixed webpage and save it

**Concepts used:** `os`, `shutil`, `re`, `requests`, file handling

---

## ✅ Task 4 — Basic Chatbot
A rule-based chatbot that responds to common user inputs.
- Recognizes greetings, small talk, jokes, and more
- Dynamic responses (e.g. current time/date)
- Randomized replies to keep the conversation natural

**Concepts used:** `if-elif`, functions, loops, input/output

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Each script is standalone and requires **Python 3**. Some tasks in `task3` require the `requests` library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Run any script directly:

```bash
python task1_hangman.py
```
